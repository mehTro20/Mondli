# What Happened?
So today instead of working more and more on the drum machine, I decided to revise the things that I've already which included bootstrap, jQuery and some react and redux, which are things that I still don't understand right now.

# The Day?
I think it was useful and well used because I had forgotten plenty of bootstrap and also some jQuery. 

# What Did You Learn?
Nothing new today personally, however, I'm not so confident on whether I'll be ready to pass the test but, let's just see what happens tomorrow.

# Plan?
Let me just see what happens tomorrow.
