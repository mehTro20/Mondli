# What Happened?
Today I finally finished react and redux and now I am beginning to do the projects that are given as tasks on freeCodeCamp, although I believe I'm still going to try and continue learn some more before I head to the back end module on freeCodeCamp.

# The Day?
The day was also a bit productive and much more progressive because of completing the tasks and beginning with the projects.

# What Did You Learn?
## Projects
- I don't have much learned today about linking the react and redux together, however , still will be learning more and more.

# Plan?
I hope by the end of this week, I will have completed one project.
- The first project I am busy with is a random quote machine.
