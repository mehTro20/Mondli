Today there wasn't much progress done because I didn't know that the whole entire code might be required to be rewritten in Jquery.
- One of the tough things that makes it difficult for the code to work the fact that keywords such as 'async' and 'await' which are necessary keywords because since the code works with an API, code has to wait before the function carries continues otherwise, it won't work.
- Now when it comes to getting those results to output into the html so we can see them reflecting on the user end, is the difficult part because when calling the function, you still have to include the await and async keywords for proper functionality and I am struggling with that since I'm coding in jQuery. 
- Where you place the async keyword is different from normal functions to class component react functions and also jQuery functions. They're all different and that's what I am currently struggling with.

# Plan?
I plan to make sure that the code works tomorrow however this might need the seniors help because, I seriously don't know what to do.
