# Project Markdown Previewer
It is to my great pleasure to write that, I am done with the markdown previewer however, this was possible with more help than I would have prefered so that next time, I would be able to build it independantly, no, I still have so much more to learn when it comes to React, however, today I celebrate that I am done with the project.
- With the problems that I experienced yesterday, there was a problem with the extensions... freeCodeCamp gave a certain link which was the extension that I was meant to use, but somehow it wasn't working and then when I checked the extension link used within the template project, it happened to be different from the one I used and when I used it, immediately, The whole preview reflected on the interface and that was the success of the project.

- I still have to try and learn React and know it not memorise it, but know it.

# Plan?
Now I have to do the drum machine and I like the pace at which I am moving because I feel that it is standard for the level of knowledge that I am right now, but I do plan on getting better and faster.
