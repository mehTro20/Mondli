# What Happened?
So far I've spent a week or at least the total of a week since working on the markerdown previewer  and even though it was only the functional part of the previewer being done, it got me to size up my coding ability, and so far, I am still a beginer and even though it's justified, I would have felt better if I was at a better level than I am now, however, it's okay, I have to keep working to get there and I eventually will.

# The Day?
The day was productive and I spent most of my time trying to see how a drum machine is built using react and so far, I haven't gotten anything lucrative that I can use or rather I haven't learned what to do yet because of the complex examples that I've come across, otherwise productive nonetheless.

# What Did You Learn?
So intially, my thoughts were that, if I only add an onClick property within the button tag and add a source for the sound to be made, is all I needed to do to make my drum machine functional enough, however... I was very wrong.
- There are certain functions that I am meant to add, functions I don't fully understand as yet, however, after I do nail these functions, then I'll be able to call them as values for the 'onClick' property

# Plan?
Being happy that I finished with the functional part of the previewer, I plan to finish with the functional part of the drum machine by next week.
