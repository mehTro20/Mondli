# What Happened...

Today I continued with learning more react using YouTube and I must say that, my understanding is broadening better and better and I feel that I have made some effective progress in learning react, so I think that I've made the decision that the rest of August will be dedicated to learning some more and more react.

# The Day...

Progressive!!! 

- Well timed as well because I made sure that the first thing I do when I arrive in class is not watching my own videos on YouTube and be distracted, and so I think how I start my days might be a very relevant topic that I should mind within myself.

# What I Learned...

## Targeting input values
- The way to do this is "e.target.value", of which you are targeting the value of the event happening with the input... 

## Hooks

- It's important to have state for where you store the list and also state to manage the inputs.

# Plan?

I have to continue with react for the rest of August and hopefully, I won't fall too far behind when it comes to rest of the work that I still have to cover.
