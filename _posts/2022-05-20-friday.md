# What Happened?
Today was an innocent Friday, and not too much work was done, and I think it might be because of the fatigue that I've been going through. 

- I tried some codes on CodeWars and not much was achieved, but Jason came to check on us.

# The Day?
Not bad and not too busy either, had visitors as well, not too much happened, just a bit of work.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Yesterday I learned about the handleChange method and today I got introduced to the handleSubmit method.

# Plan?
Next week is a new week and my aim is to make as productive as possible. Nothing else in my head right now.
