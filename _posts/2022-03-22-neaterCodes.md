# What Happened?
I think if Monday was made to be the new Sunday and the weekends having 4 days instead of just 3, then Tuesday would be the new Monday because it didn't feel like a second day of a week today but the first, meaning it was slow but I got to work some more on fCC today and pushed.

# The Day?
Slow but steady and productive mentally, especially because of the problems that I came across because I understood them and requested help where I met trouble. Smoother than expected.

# What Did You Learn?
## Map Method
- This method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element.
- Does not mutate the original array.
- Pure function, also takes another function as it argument.

## Filter Method
- This method calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true.
- Filters the array based on the function passed to it. 
- Does not mutate the original array.

## Slice Method
- I've come across this before during the time I've been learning javaScript and it's basic use is to delete or 'slice' and item within an array however in today's case, it's not meant to alter an original array, but create a new one from the old one.

# Plan?
I plan of finishing the functional programming and I think I should begin with my to do list, which is Moral's project and try to mentally take breaks between these two tasks and see how I cope.
