# What Happened...

Today I continued with the test that Moral has given me and I'm just about around 90% done with it however, I feel that perhaps I've taken a shortcut that may count against me later on.

# The Day...

I wouldn't say that there were train smashes although there's something I'm not understanding about state and manipulating it.

- It the code I set up, takes all input as strings, now I don't understand why I had to have an object with a single key for it to work because if the default state was not set up to be an object and just an empty string, somehow, the code just won't work. But I'll try to remember to get to the bottom of this.

# What I Learned...

The error that I mentioned above, is something that troubled me and since changing default state from an empty string into an object with a single key set to an empty string, somehow the code works, but there is definitely something that I don't understand.

# Plan...

I have to be done with this project by tomorrow... I think because of the "eval" method, I might be penalized, so if possible, of which I'm definitely willing, I may just write some other code on the side differently from how I've done this initial one but without the eval method.
