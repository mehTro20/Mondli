# What Happened?
So outside coding and doing more and more freeCodeCamp I managed to plan how my week will go and decided that I should complete or at least be left with only the JavaScript projects. So I can say that I did some learning, some applying and some planning as well.
- I completed regular expression and debugging.

# The Day?
The day went well, I was focused and had my eyes on the goal, which was to finish regular expressions and to debugging and I happen to reach that goal which is a green let's go forward for me.

# What Did You Learn?
## Debugging
- This section covers plenty of tiny, unnoticable mistakes we make when running code. javaScript doesn't run at all when there an error in sytax and possibly when there a humbling spelling error as well and so, debugging is very important.

- Another thing that can influence code or influence how your code runs is arrangement of the code, declaring too early or too late, inside functions or outside functions, all of it will affect how your code run thus affecting the results.

- Some code such as strings will use the double apostrophe/inverted commas/apostrophe, now imagine code:
`Let sentence = 'I have arrived, here's the stuff'`
- The code will read until the word 'here' and anything beyond the apostrophe won't be read. The solution to this is:
- `Let sentence = "I have arrived, here's the stuff"` < So right there, would be the solution, using the inverted commas.

# Plan?
I plan on being done with most of javaScript by the end of this week. Starting with Basic Algorithm Scripting & Object Oriented Programming.
