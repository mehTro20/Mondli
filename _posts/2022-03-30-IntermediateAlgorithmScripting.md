# What Happened?
Had an early morning with plans to achieve today's goal and I am currently on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting sub-section of javaScript of the freeCodeCamp, covered at least 20% already

# The Day?
Productive overall and the current section that I am on is very challenging and does not play with kids, and it covers stuff the I had to learn from google and really requires attention, if I had more time, I would definitely give it more attention and keep fighting. But a productive day all round.

# What Did You Learn?
## The 'every' Method
- This method is used to check that every element in an array meet a particular criteria, for example:

```
const arr = [-2, 3, 6, 8, 9]

arr.every(function(elem){
    return elem < 10;
});
```

- In the code given above the every() method is meant to check whether all elements within the array are less than 10 and so the output would be true.

## Some Method
- Unlike the every() method explained above. the some method is meant to check if some of the items within an array fit the condition statement instead of all of the items like the strict every() method.

## Match Method
- The match() method retieves the result of matching a string against a regular expression.

```
const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.';
const regex = /[A-Z]/g;
const found = paragraph.match(regex);

console.log(found);
```

- The output will be: Array ["T", "I"]

# Plan?
I have to be finished with this sub-section by tomorrow so I can move on and finish Javascript as well.
