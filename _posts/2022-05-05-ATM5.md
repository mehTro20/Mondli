# What Happened?
I had to commit a whole day to the project with hopes that I could finally get where I needed it to be. Unfortunately, this whole day had no progress whatsoever and I didn't even think to delegate or rather try to do something else with it.
- Due to the team effort that we are doing with Nox, we decided for it to be a whole group thing where we all benefit and all of us pay attention and learn even though it is revision for us.

# The Day?
Today was a particulary long day because of the problem that I am facing today. I would even say difficult however in terms of emotions, no problems there whatsoever and that would include stuff such as frustration. I will find the solution to it.

# What Did You Learn?
- Only due to the fact that I focused on a single problem the whole day, I can't say anything new was learned especially since I chose that I should focus only on the project so I do not get distracted when it comes to learning React. I don't want my mind multitasking for it.

# Plan?
If I cannot find the solution before 12 tomorrow, then I will ask the seniors for help.
