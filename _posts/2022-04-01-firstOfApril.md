# What Happened?
Today was another day dedicated to Code Wars and trying to apply my mind with fairly easy codes to solve as just training and building myself with the knowledge of Javascript.

# The Day?
The day was a fairly good one as I was conquering all those katas and building my skill up.

# What Did You Learn?
## Number
- I had a task where a function wanted a sum of two arguments in string form. The arguments had to be strings and the returned value had to be a string. 
- I had to convert the string to a number, then add those given inputs as numbers and convert them back to strings. The code is as follows...

```
let a = "16"
const b = Number(a)
```

- The value of 'a' is a string 16 but the value of 'b' is the number 16.

# Plan?
I want to get my code wars number to at least 80 before I return to freeCodeCamp.
