# Project Drum Machine
I am believing to have some thoughts that perhaps this task is currently something of a nature that is beyond my level, something above my class of knowledge right now and maybe I was too quick in trying such a task myself because I am one day away from labelling it 'difficult'.

- My initial idea was to make sure that I have buttons and create functions to call for onClick functionality and it seems that, it does not work as easily as I thought because there is a manipulation of state that needs to take place since it is react js.

- My next try and/or idea is to give focus to state and to make sure I understand it and also try to use the span keyword and try to get those button values perhaps as an array and see if something different will happen.

# Plan?
The difficulty of this drum machine for me has tempered with my confidence as well and that will decline my effective learning if I am not careful, and so now my plan has become that if I don't complete this drum machine within a week, I am going to move on and try it another time when I have more knowledge with react js.
