# What Happened?
As usual, I started my day off with some ed club typing lessons and some type racing just to warm myself up for the day ahead, then soon after I continued with the FreeCodeCamp on ES6 and then was unrudely interrupted for presentations from the seniors where they taught us a few things that we didn't know.

# The Day?
I would say smooth and not stressful at all again, most probably because ES6 seems easy or one can rather say, easily understandable. I was learning a lot about destructering on FCC.

# What Did You Learn?
## Using the rest parameter with function parameters
- So if I could try explain the rest parameter to someone who knows nothing about coding, I would say that instead of the person compiling a list of numbers of which the numbers may identify a list of items or lables for people or anything, instead of compiling those list of numbers, they should instead you a sense of ecetera given that the numbers are in a normal linear pattern (counting from 1 upwards without skipping). And so the code basically goes like this: 
<const product = (n1, n2, n3) => {
    const args = [n1, n2, n3];
}> So then instead of writing it that way, all you would do is:
<const product = (...n) => {}>
which makes the code much more cleaner.

## Spread Operator
- So the spread operator is a direct function code in JavaScript ES6 and often looks like: <const mo = ['I', 'am', 'Mondli'];> and that is an array and when I <console.log(...mo)> my output will be "I am Mondli", which of course is very similar to our rest parameter.

## Using destructuring assignment
- Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables. Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an arrayâ€‹ at a time.
And that's the best explaination that I've ever had from google.

# Plan?
I plan on finishing ES6 next week and try to increase pace on my learning and overall performance, nothing less.
