# Project Quote Generator Machine
I don't know if I have mentioned this already before but the class and component way of doing the react framework seems to not work at all with codepen and that is the intergrated development environment (IDE), in which freeCodeCamp will test our projects before allowing passage to the next task.
- So today I took the initiative to go back and to try understand jQuery because the example we were given of the project used plenty of jQuery.

- The conclusion of the day though is that I should try and get it working on VScode first and then do the necessary translation or conversion form the VScode into something that codepen will accept.
