# What Happened?
Today I commited a full day to try and handle the tasks at hand on the freeCodeCamp and not much was done because the codes are very difficult and tough, but nonetheless, I am still up for the challenge, and if it was up to me, I would re-do the whole javaScript until this language is nothing to me anymore. But anyway, that is what happened today.

# The Day?
Not too hectic on my side however, I do believe in spend too much time thinking instead of doing and that results in more than an hour and sometimes even two consumed on a single task, I do believe I should change this.

# What Did You Learn?
## Arguments
So, every single function is meant to have parameter to take as arguments so it functionality can be tested and sometimes those arguments are not a definite amount of only 2 or ten, but can exceed that amount, and so the arguments makes even those possible arguments that may be input to not bug the function.

```
function args(){

    let allOfThem = [...arguments]
}
```

- The variable 'allOfThem' would consist of every possible argument a human being would try put in when calling the function.

# Plan?
I have to carry on with the freeCodeCamp until I finish javaScript.
