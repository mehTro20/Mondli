# What Happened...

Today, I continued with the test that I was given with the new plan of trying to build this calculator but without the eval() method and I won't say that it's been a walk in the park but there is definitely something that I realized about myself.

# The Day...

Today was a mentally busy day because there was a alot to think about since our approach to the code had to be different and one of the struggles was this...

- In the process of compiling something I had already planned, then immediately think of something better which disturbs the process and time would be consumed because, I not skilled enough to immediately execute want I am thinking about and I might need google for some other things.

- But I ended up doing the first thing I thought of anyway because, I decided that it's better that I execute it and then work from there.

# What I Learned...
## Process

- I think it rather better to go with something you've already planned to do and then apply changes later than being stuck in the process of doing and the pausing because I've thought about something else.

# Plan?

Mongo DB and Mongoose.
