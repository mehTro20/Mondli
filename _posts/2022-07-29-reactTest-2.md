# What Happened?
Today was the day we write the test that I was trying to prepare for yesterday and I have to say that, although I may have not passed it or rather performed excellently, I've made effective progress in terms of learning react and trying to master it.

# The Day?
I won't say as stressful as it may have been had I not known how to do functional react... It could've been worse, but there was a fair bit of stress today and the thing with coding is that, you could be a single letter off the right thing and then wipe out everything because of the problem and try something else where as, you could have fixed that single letter and the whole thing was going to be functioning smoothly. Coding is that simple but difficult.

# What Did You Learn?
## Hooks
- I only learned about hooks yesterday and they're something I haven't mastered yet, however, I learned that they can be used differently and that they are the key to manipulating and utilizing state.

## React
- I learned that functional react is better in everyway than class component based type of react.

# Plan?
We still have the drum machine to get done and I am more confident that I will make appropriate progress becuause of my newly learned "functional react".
