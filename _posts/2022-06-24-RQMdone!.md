# Project Quote Generator Machine
It is with great joy that I write that I am done with the random quote machine.
- I had a specific goal to be able to do it with class components react and also jQuery and one of the biggest problems of the day, including the functionality was the humble spelling error and I had made that mistake with an id that contains the entire html and because of that, plenty of things weren't working, and only after fixing that mistake, then a lot of those marks were suddenly given.

- Another problem that I was encountering with jQuery was thinking that I should call the function the same way as calling within class component React, however it is called normally unlike React, meaning that I had to include the brackets next to the function name.

- Another thing that I realized was that within a jQuery function, I can still normal declare a variable like normal js and so after overcoming all those problems mentioned above, I was able to pass the test and now, I am going to do the next project which is a markdown previewer.

# Plan?
With the markdown previewer first thoughts were "Oh, no, this is difficult", however, I am going to change that now and I plan to finish with it's functionality by the end of the week and it will be a bonus if I can pull it off before the week ends.
