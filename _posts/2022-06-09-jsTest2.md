# What Happened?
Today was the test of the second javaScript test, and although we weren't sure about what we were going to write about regarding js, I would say, that I wrote quite surprisingly okay.

# The Day?
I actually had a horrible day today because of how my morning started, and since it not code related, I would rather not say, however, after writing the test was my mood placed in a better space.

# What Did You Learn?
## Methods
- From the test, since we were heavily working with arrays and objects, I from when I didn't know what to do, I began playing around with the map, filter and reduce methods to try mutate or rather create new array off of the original, and I can say that I am beggining to understand these methods more and more and more since, it actually seems that they override for loops when it comes to working with arrays.

# Plan?
For tomorrow, I will continue with the normal freeCodeCamp plan that I've had to learn more and more react js and redux.
