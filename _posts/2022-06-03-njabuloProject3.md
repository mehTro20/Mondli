# What Happened?
Today, Njabulo requested that the add ons to his project be done by 11 o'clock today and fortunately enough for me because of good decisions, I decided to start the whole things over so I could do it in a way that I would understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
- For the rest of the day, I continued studying the project and trying to learn React better and better for myself.

# The Day?
Due to the pressure I had, I would say it is a successful and productive day and plenty of progress and learning regarding React.
- A good day all in all.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Getting the project done and doing things the way freeCodeCamp has taught me, has made me understand things better and understand props, state, the "this" keyword and it's used and plenty other things concerning react. All thanks to the project and the freeCodeCamp.

# Plan?
I plan to complete redux and continue with the following section of the front end dev section.
