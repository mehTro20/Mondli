# What Happened...
As planned, I started over with D3 however, the result was not as I expected because the later tasks seem to have their own level of difficulty whether you remember what is happening or not however, even with all that difficulty, I still managed to make it past D3 and JSON and Ajax today alone.

# The Day...
I would say more challenging and a lot more reading and try to learn strictly from reading which is something that is difficult for me or rather, is not as effective of communication for me when it comes to learning something, whatever that could be.

# What I Learned...

## D3
- The manipulation of the data is quite broad and the code gets more and more complicated with the detail that is required to show, especially on the UI however, the code set up/makeup is very similar to jQuery.

## JSON APIs and AJAX
 I can't say that this is something of which I memorized everything that is required to make this successful or functional because there is so much code that goes into the writing however, what I did learn is how to make calls to the live server, something similar to the random quote machine that I did earlier in the React section

- This is part of code that requires asychronous calls to a live server and an object is returned and we work with the data that is place within this object.

# Plan?

Tomorrow is the day that Tumi will have to give up the laptop he has been using to work, to me because the Raspberry pie is slow and often lags when running code, I plan on transferring everything to the laptop and that's where I'll be working from now on.

- I also plan on beginning with the projects tomorrow with the goal of hopefully finishing at least 3 by Friday.
