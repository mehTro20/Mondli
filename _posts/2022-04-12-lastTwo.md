# What Happened?
As planned, I carried on with javaScript on the freeCodeCamp and attempted a few code war problems, nothing much out of the day but just those two today.

# The Day?
I have to say, lazier than yesterday however, I'm still working to try and build better habits keep the words of encouragement from Mandla and Theo, but a successful day none the less, javaScript algorithm scripting is not getting any more difficult for me and so I can claim that we are winning the war.

# What Did You Learn?
Today, I cannot say there is anything new that I've learned outside more about roman numerals, and roman numerals aren't necessarily a javaScript orientated thing and so, aren't worth having a sub heading or even explanations about them.

# Plan?
I am only two tasks from finishing javaScript on freeCodeCamp so I plan to finally finish with javaScript on freeCodeCamp tomorrow.
