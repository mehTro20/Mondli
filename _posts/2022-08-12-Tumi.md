# What Happened...
Today I realized something about myself and my work ethic and how truly focused I am...
- I have to say that no. I really have to start from the beginning again because it seems that I am not focused at all and I am not pushing myself as much as I should and I am distracted through the bad habit that I've gotten myself used to.

- Tumi came in and reminded me of a task that he wanted me to try out and that was to make another calculator app without using the eval method and I had already forgotten about it..

- He then tried to help me and testing me with the to do list that I was already busy with, and then gave me a few pointers here and there about the table and how to get the value from my inputs and then as soon as he let me be, to continue on my own...

- This is when I realized just how quick my focus switched from the to do list to my phone and YouTube and Instagram.

If I carry on this way, nothing and absolutely nothing will work for me and I will fail in this journey.

# Plan?

I don't have a plan as yet, but I have to get rid of all these bad habits and try to do better...
