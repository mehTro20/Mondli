# What Happened?
Today, I decided to try and get to understand state more and more and also work abit on the freeCodeCamp as well and also worked some more on understanding react & redux.

# The Day?
Not as productive again however still more and more learning happening and did outsource to Youtube as well for better understanding and it actually helped and essentially worked because I believe I understand what state is.

# What Did You Learn?
## State
- State is the description of the condition of your app. If you think of a battery of a phone, when fully charged, the state of the battery is 100% and any change from that, will result in the change of state of the battery.

# Plan?
I have to work more and more in working to understand React and Redux and I am taking the right steps, so I will keep at it.
