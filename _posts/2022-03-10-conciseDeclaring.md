# What Happened?
I was able to have progress today on freeCodeCamp today after a morning of typeracer to test how my typing skills have improved and I can safely claim that I am the top of my class when it comes typing speed, typing accuracy as well and everything thing typing than the rest of my peers. In fact, just yesterday I was typing faster than 2 of the second years students and I can even claim that I am faster than all the second year students too. I guess all that awaits me from total domination is catching up with the actual coding as well, which is a sure thing, might I add.

# The Day?
A bit straining on the ES6 today, had a surprise of some difficult questions and couldn't try and apply some thinking quick enough and after a few errors, was forced to get a hint and eventually look up the solution when the hints didn't help either, however, that was on one task out of about 4 that I managed to cover on the freeCodeCamp today.

# What Did You Learn?
## Object property shorthand
- Lets say you have a function with 2 or more parameters(or even 1) and within the function you want to assign these parameters or object literals... so intead of the following code:
`const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
});`
- ES6 allows us to turn that code to:
`const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });`

## Concise declarative functions
- So in a code when you create a declarative function, instead of doing the following:
`functionName: function() {};` and can now rather, `functionName(){};` when writing a declarative function.

## The class syntax
- I cannot say much about this topic because I really did not understand the lesson but just used the given example to try and solve the given task, however, did I understand what I was doing? No.

## getters & setters
- The same misunderstanding goes for this topic, too many new things at a time because things such as, 'private object variables' were mention and an underscore for the first time in code and I just simply did not understand here. In fact this was the question of the day that kept me frustrated and I just don't know what is happening.

# Plan?
I had a certain idea to try and give my code wars account more time and energy, I have the feeling that I'll be able to learn plenty of application in coding especially learning more javascript and coming across problems that I haven't necessarily come across on freeCodeCamp. But I want to finish with ES6 first before I can try this.
