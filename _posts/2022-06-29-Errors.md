# Project Markdown Previewer
Today I continued to work on this project but not on my repo anymore but on codepen so I can submit it simply as soon as I'm done with it.
- While doing so, I experience a couple of problems that regarded codepen itself and it inability to run class based React and so, today I learned about extensions that you can add on codepen to allow it to run that type of react js.
- And then the second error that I came across today is that within the marking 'rubric' if I may call it that, I have to have different tags within the previewer or rather style of those particular tags such as h1, h2, h3 and p... and at that time, my code was allowing me to use a single tag so the previewer outputs properly and so this meant that I had to restart from scratch about how I go about my project when it comes to the preview/outputing the content. And that was the rest of the day, and I am still stuck.

# Plan?
Right now, I have an idea however, idk if it will work but it is to define a variable and set it to something with those required tags but I don't think it will work right now.
