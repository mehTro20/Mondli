# What Happened?
Today was the 2nd day working with the project given to us by Njabulo and it took the rest of the day today for me with the only problem being how to use the local storage properties properly.

- Today I also used one of the great Mandla's words of wisdom. Mandla said that I should try and get one thing working first before working on the next one, and so, I did exactly that when I was not getting the local storage to work properly, I decided to use normal default values to get the code working before introducing the local storage and it was a really good idea.

# The Day?
Well, because I got everything that I had to get working, working and functional, I would say successful day and very educative as well, however the low of the day is that it was time consuming and I feel that time was wasted, but successful nonetheless.

# What Did You Learn?
## localStorage
- One of the things I learned today is that if the key of the item in the local storage is the same but the value of that key is changes, then you're not creating a different object but you're only mutating/changing the value of that key.

# Plan?
Tomorrow is a national holiday however, I'll still be coming so I can work some more and try catch up with as much work as I can, so the plan is to continue tomorrow.
