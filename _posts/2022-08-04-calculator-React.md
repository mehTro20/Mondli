# What Happened...
Today, I focused all of the day on fixing and finishing the task that Njabulo gave me on React and when I did actually finish, he gave me another task to transform the whole function into an actual calculator this time which is another level up the difficulty of the task which is good if I hope to work and master react anytime soon.

# The Day...
Busy and active and effective as well because I am beginning to actually think and I am beginning to process and ask myself questions that I need to be asking myself to attain the necessary progress within the code that I am writing, and I hope that I do the correct things required with as little google as I can.

# What You Learned...
## React
- I am beginning to believe that it is actually better to start with something on an easier scale than to try and get the whole thing within one go and get everything correct with one single try. In fact, trying to get everything correct in one go for me is actually more time consuming.

# Plan?
I am worried about time on my side, especially when it comes to being on par with the target set by the syllabus, I don't want to be too behind, but tomorrow, I am still going to be working with the calculator tomorrow and perhaps I will try and do the freeCodeCamp latest Wednesday.
