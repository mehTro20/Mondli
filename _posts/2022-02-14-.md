# What Happened?
It's been a trip but I've finally managed to finish the Responsive Web Designs. I am finally done with CSS & HTML on FreeCodeCamp.

# The Day?
Not too busy or troubling. Conveniently, the missing piece on the personal portfolio I was busy with, happened to be similar code to the task we recieved on Friday, from the 2nd year students. So it was an easy valentine's.

# Plan?
I will be learning JavaScript however, unlike HTML & CSS, I won't be sourcing information from only FreeCodeCamp but other websites such as YouTube. That is my plan for this entire week.
