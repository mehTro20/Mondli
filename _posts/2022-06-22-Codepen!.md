# Project Quote Generator Machine

I have done the work I needed to do and reached the goal that I set up for myself yesterday however, it seems that I have to do the whole project again to suit the set up that is done with codepen... I don't know whether there something to make class components react js work in codepen however, I have to rewrite the code differently so it works on the codepen.

- Yesterday my biggest struggle was making sure that the quote matches it's author and I needed some help from the seniors to find the best solution and that solution what how I call the values of state within the rendered part of the React js.

- The function I was using to set new state was setting for the quote and author as props separately and my idea was to try and filter out the whole array from the api to get the object where the result of the first call of the function should give us that object and thus taking the author value from it and it didn't work because I couldn't get the value of the first call into the function for the author.

- The senior that helped me showed me something I didn't think was possible and that was that within the rendered batch in my code, I would call the values of state as...

```
<h1>{this.state.quote}</h1>
<p>{this.state.author}</p>
```

... however the senior showed me that I could rather do it like this...

```
<h1>{this.state.quote.text}</h1>
<p>{this.state.quote.author}</p>
```

... where "quote" is the property within the setState function with it's value set to the call of the function, which is a function that returns an object.

# Plan?
Right now, tomorrow is the day I have to try and rewrite the code and make sure that I at least get it functional using a majority of jQuery syntax.
