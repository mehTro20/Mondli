# What Happened...
Today I started the morning with the intention of doing sommething with the new to do list, doing something as much as I can without google and then quickly lost energy to carry on with that and tried working on the objective I've set up for myself and came across some problems that I'm still thinking of a way of which I have to overcome them.

- So throughout the day, I decided to work on code wars for the first time in a very long time perhaps since more than 2 months ago.

# The Day...

Not too stressful, but I the wrong thing that I did with codeWars was to try and kata that is quite out of my rusty range and so most of the day got consumed with it...

- Since I am still trying to recover, I know that we're meant to make as much effective use of Google but I really want to make sure that I know what I'm doing when it comes to coding.

# Plan?

So far, for tomorrow, I will not lie, however, I don't have a particular plan so I think the best for me would be to return and do some more and more code wars just to return my technical skill of js as well...
