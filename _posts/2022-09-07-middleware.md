# What Happened...

Today I continued some more with the back end development tasks in the freeCodeCamp and I've gotten some progress done, although like I did mention yesterday, the back end development is something that is quite unusual and tricky however, bit by bit I am beginning to connect the dots.

# The Day...

Smooth but demanding when it comes to the tasks.

- One of the few mistakes I made today was not reading the questions clearly, so I would get about 90% of the required code tasks done and be stuck after doing it properly but because of not reading the question, then trouble and some time consumed and frustrations sometimes.

# What I Learned...
### Reading 

- Often times, not paying attention to the code will result in an error where you could potentially believe that what you've written is the wrong thing but to only find that there's been a small typing error for a single term within the code that resulted in the whole thing crashing, and this goes for careful reading as well because not understanding what is required will result in failure.

# Plan?

I am about 60% done with the back end development, so by this week, I plan to be done with the whole thing.
