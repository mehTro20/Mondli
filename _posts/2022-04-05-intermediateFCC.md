# What Happened?
I continued as planned with the freeCodeCamp tasks that I still have to do. A particular student is exactly were I am currently and he has been dealing with the codes independently with help from time to time. I am mentioning this because I felt that the current difficulty of the intermediate algorithm scripting was too much for me, I believed that it was more than I could handle but seeing a classmate handling them, made me more positive and changed my attitude and approach to the whole thing and I can see the difference.

# The Day?
I would say a normal day at the office with some bagged battles and enough victory in the day and I would say better days lie ahead and more thinking outside the box is needed but also well balanced with what we already know.

# What Did You Learn?
## charCodeAt Method
- This is a javaScript method that retrieves the specific Unicode value of a character present at the specified index, this goes for all characters from punctuation to numbers to the alphabet.

# Plan?
I have to complete javaScript so I am back with that goal in mind, more so because I do feel that this is a steep hill, completing javaScript however when I am done, it could be a downhill jam, meaning stuff I can easily handle.
