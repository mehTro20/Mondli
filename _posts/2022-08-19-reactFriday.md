# What Happened...

Today we carried on with the project that Tumi gave us and continued with it...

- Jason also came by, I think primarily to see Muano but that can easily turn into a check up on all of us.

# The Day...

The day was very similar to the past 3-4 days of continued and newly found productivity and some sense of satisfaction because each day has it's own solutions.

- It was also good to see Jason.

# What I learned...
## useNavigate
Today, I finally understood how to change pages within a react app and the true use of the hook, "useNavigate"...

- So I have to define a variable and set it to hook itself before being able to use it and so I had an idea on which page should be loaded according to the options the user will select.

- The initial plan was basic js if and else statement without knowing that I could have done that within the actual method to navigate itself.

# Plan?

I want to be done with the functionality of the whole app by at least Wednesday.
