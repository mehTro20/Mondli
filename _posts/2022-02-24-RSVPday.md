# What Happened?
For the entire day today I have focused on the RSVP we've been given including the bit of ed-club to keep working on my typing. The RSVP is looking good so far.

# The Day?
The day went well and I've been working on the RSVP and I really can't say that much more about today.

# What Did You Learn?
Because I didn't get up to any FreeCodeCamp today I will rather talk about what I applied to the RSVP to make it appealing so far. 

- I was reminded that in html, when working with input tags, depending on what you wish the user to input, it is important to add the "type" attribute to avoid the user writing the wrong information at the wrong place.

- I learned that in CSS you can apply different methods for the same result for example if I set a display to flex and set the flex direction to column, then items within that class or id or direct tags being styled, will be below eachother, and if I don't use that method, I can use the CSS grid by setting the display to grid and adding the "grid-template-columns" property to the class and then directing those elements manually by setting those different values.

- There's also so more that I've been reminded of, however I did not neccesarily learn anyting new.

# Plan?
I have the same plan tomorrow to keep working on the RSVP until it reaches satisfactory level or even beyond.
