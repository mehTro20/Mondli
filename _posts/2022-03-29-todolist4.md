# What Happened?
Today was actually meant to be a day in which I was excused because of the driver's license that I applied for. I had already told Njabulo about it in hand and he told me that it was okay. And what happened is that I came back a fully certified driver for small and intermediate (small trucks and buses) vehicles! 
- However, I finished early at the testing centre and could make it back to the coding grounds around 12h20 instead of spending the rest of the day home.
- I then continued to work on the to do list with not so much effective work on it because I didn't know how to apply the idea I had in my head.
- No freeCodeCamp.

# The Day?
A very good day personally but internally(The Coding Grounds), not a good day as my to do list is an incomplete one, decorative and coding wise.

# What Did You Learn?
Today, I was trying to learn how the code I used for my delete function works because it has node in it and sites didn't teach me to understand, so I didn't necessarily learn anything today.

# Plan?
Its only two more day until March of this year is gone forever, so I have to finish javaScript on fCC and so that's it for the to do list.
