# What Happened?
Today I have to say that I probably forced myself to come to school here today because I felt weak the whole day. I felt fatigued and I would also say a sense of mental fatigue in some way, but I just was not 100%.
- I decided to do some kata on codeWars the whole entire day.

# The Day?
It was the slowest day this year solely because of the way I was feeling, however when it comes to the kata that I had to do, that was successful and maintained my confidence with javaScript, which is something that I think is important.

# What Did You Learn?
## Math.sqrt() Method
- I came across a kata that required me to work out the area of a rectangle and I would be given the diagonal value and width value, and the area formula uses the square root without those two values, and so, I stumbled on this method.

# Plan?
Tomorrow is interviews and so, I plan on doing the best I can even though I am a first year student here at tcg, it wouldn't hurt to be able to ace an interview because someday it will be much more relevant and important than today.
