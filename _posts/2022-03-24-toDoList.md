# What Happened?
Today I focused all my energy in the to do list project that Moral gave us, which is due next week Monday(28March), and I don't have a lot of time left and thought it be wise that I work on it in time because I am anticipating problems and nothing is ever smooth with projects, and to no surprise, that's exactly what happened.

# The Day?
I haven't spent too much time struggling with a single problem so there was no frustration today, nor can I call it a victory because the war is no done yet.

# What Did You Learn?
## HTML tags
- Today I learned about the table tags and the subtags that go under the table when I want the structure of my html to be a column and not a row. The code is as follows:

```
<table>
        <tr>
            <td>heading1</td>
            <td>heading2</td>
            <td>heading3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>belowHeading1</th>
            <th>belowHeading2</th>
            <th>belowHeading3</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
```

# Plan?
Tomorrow I plan on continuing with the to-do-list with hopes of completing the projects otherwise I might have to make plans to work during the weekend.
