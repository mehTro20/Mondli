# Project Calculator
So today I continued with the calculator and one of the things that I'm struggling with is how to clear state when I begin a new equation...

## How it Works...
So the values I punch in are passed as a string into the state and then when I punch the equal sign, that runs a function that uses the evaluate method to calculate the values even when it's a single string, magic I tell you, and the result of that sets another state that is then printed as the output on the front-end.

- So I have another button that I titled that "AC" button which will clear both states, making it safe enough to begin another equation.

# Plan?
I have the function that happens when the "AC" button is hit is something that I need to happen when I begin a new equation without hitting the "AC" button, and so that the last thing that I will try before asking Njabulo for a new project or task.
