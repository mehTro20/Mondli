# Introduction

Most of this week was focused on catch up work concerning the training we've received from Microsoft which is training based on using their powerapps platforms.

Which also means plenty of work from my side and extra hours put in because I missed a lot during the 2 weeks I was not here in The Coding Grounds.

# Body

The work that is awaiting me is practical based work with clear instructions for me to follow in order to complete the tasks at hand.

Following those instructions is easy however, one of the things I complained about even back to when I was learning JavaScript is, not seeing the effects of the changes that I make when I make them and not being able to test those changes.

In the lab work that I am currently busy with, we're overloaded with instructions but we can never really test and see what those changes are or the effects of the changes we make.

# Conclusion

Since I am still working on catching up, and going to continue to put in the extra work, coming in on weekends and leaving late so at least I can catch up with all the work that is outstanding.
