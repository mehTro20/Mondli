# What Happened?
Today I began with Redux on freeCodeCamp, the whole day it is what I did and focused on and I believe that by tomorrow I will be done with it because it is an easier than React section.

# The Day?
I would happily say that it was very productive and progressive.
- I paid close attention to the wording and terms of redux and understood what I had to do within the tasks that I was given however, I still believe that a more practical task such as a project will help me understand more instead of just memorize the terms and their use.

# What Did You Learn?
## Redux
- I've learned that Redux is a frame work that manages state, so you can think of it as a whole frame-work that is dedicated to managing state it all types of ways.
- I came across terms such as reducers, dispatching, action amongst others and I have to actually get a more practical lesson to be more educated and learn better about Redux.

# Plan?
I will finish Redux tomorrow and continue some more with the freeCodeCamp so I can be able to return and try learn again by working the tasks again.
