# What Happened?
Today, similarly to yesterday, I focused all of my attention to finding the solution to the problem that I had, and unfortunately, no progress in that problem, however, a discovery nonetheless.
- I realized that even the seniors don't now what to do or how to get it done, meaning that it's a real life problem and its not a simple problem because of experience. But I did apply other things to the project such as if a user creates an account, they're immediately logged in that account and also an exit button if someone is already logged in.

# The Day?
The day went well although not a total victory, I just believe in my mental state and my confidence about javaScript. 

# What Did You Learn?
- Again, today was just a nothing new day because of my uninterrupted focus on the ATM.

# Plan?
I plan on coming in tomorrow because I have no plans for anything tomorrow and I will dedicate the day to learning more and more about React on freeCodeCamp.
