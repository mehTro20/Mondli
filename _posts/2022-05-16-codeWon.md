# What Happend?
Today, from yesterday evening at around 10 o'clock, I have been travelling from kzn and because I don't want to fall behind any more, I decided that I have to make it to class and continue with my tasks... only to be able to solve a code war and keeping dosing out the entire from lack of enough rest.

# The Day?
I usually have nice internal celebrations for every code I solve on code wars and the one I solved today has been troubling me for some time and I kept on trying to find creative ways to solve it using the information about Javascript that I do have.
- So today in particular, after I solved the code, I had mixed feelings after I saw other people's solutions because there had been a method I knew nothing about this whole time. 
- The rest of the day, I don't want to lie, I was exhausted guys.

# What Did You Learn?
## endsWith() Method
- This is a method that return a boolean true value if a string ends with a specified string.

# Plan?
I am going back to focusing on freeCodeCamp tomorrow and I should prepare for a javaScript test as well that we could write this coming week.
