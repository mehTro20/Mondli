# What Happenend?
I'm not sure why I didn't spend the rest of today at home because I was sick however, with the deadline I've set up for myself, I didn't give myself much of a choice and I had a to come to and work and pushed more and more freeCodeCamp, the whole day.

# The Day?
I would say that it was one of the most stressful days since I managed to have a certain mentality and approach to difficult tasks on freeCodeCamp, and this is because of the stress within the algorithm subsection and the tasks there. I was demotivated, I cannot lie and the sickness didn't make it any better. Bad day.

# What Did You Learn?
- I cannot list anything that I learned today because there wasn't that much learning but much rather applying above all else however, I wish to revisit plenty of basic javascript to recall most that I've learned and this is vital because I was left feeling demotivated and feeling as if this language is very difficult but I won't let that stop me from learning the language. It's not an easy language and I am still having a difficult time trying to understand it.

# Plan?
By tomorrow I have to be done with at least half of the following topic after the algorithm topic and I have to get back up and try to handle these problems better because I realized that when I struggle with something and I don't keep a cool head about it, I tend to run away to do something easier and something I'm fairly confident in, of which that is fast typing in this case, and that does not lead my any closer to finding the solution and plenty of time is wasted.
