# What Happened...
Today I continued back on freeCodeCamp because I do have to catch up to at least when it comes to the syllabus that is set up for us.

- The downfall that I experienced though today is that I have completely forgotten about the D3 and now, tomorrow, I might have to begin from the beginning of D3 before understanding D3 properly again.

# The Day...

Today was a proper day and I have had to get back into the groove of the freeCodeCamp and learning again from some instruction and not strictly google.

# What I Learned...

## D3

Because of having such a long time without doing D3, to make sure that I understand what I am doing going forward, I do have to start over with everything but I think a single day will be enough...

# Plan?
Yes, I will have to start over with D3 if I hope to achieve understanding and effective learning.
