# Project Markdown Previewer
So one of the questions that I had for myself was whether I could do something to the input field and try to make it more like a form or similar behaviour to a form and I finally got my answer today, which is something I've learned before, however, did forget that it existed.
- So the answer to my question is a clear no. You cannot mutate or manipulate an input field to behave any other way beyond it's purpose, however, there is something.
- Which brings me to the solution that I was faced with, which happens to be 'textarea'.
- The textarea tag is an html tag that is similar to an input field however the difference is that it can be expanded without the use of css and can separate text by means of lining and not spacing only like input fields, which was exactly what I was looking for, and since I've found this solution, I believe by tomorrow I will be done with this project.

# Plan?
I plan to finish with the functionality of the markdown previewer tomorrow unless I come across something hugely unexpected, and by finishing, I mean having the functionality of the project done, not necessarily the final touch/product.
