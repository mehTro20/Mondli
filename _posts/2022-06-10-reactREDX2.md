# What Happened?
Today I finally continued some more with freeCodeCamp and learned some more about redux than react with the two exercises that I got busy with today. 
- We also had a visit from Carolyn who's a mentor amongst other things and taught us about some communication. More and more communication.

# The Day?
Today was a learning day some more as much as most days, however, the difference is that we were taught more about communication covering for us in future when applying for jobs and also generally being good conversationalists.

# What Did You Learn?
## Communication
- Today I learned more about communication and things around that topic and working with people and how personal relationships can be important and how to present yourself, etc.
- We also learned about having to present who you are and what you do and having to practice that to be more and more good at it, which is a very useful skill we need.

# Plan?
 I plan on finishing with react and redux next week.
