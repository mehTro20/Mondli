# What Happened?
Today, we, the first year students, wrote a javaScript test that consisted of four questions and were algorithm based and fairly easy, although not necessarily easy for me.

# The Day?
The day was a slow and long day, and for me, it's only because of personal reasons, the whole day has been weightful for me because a personal thing that took place at home, of which I can't share here because these blogs are about my progression in my quest to learn code.

# What Did You Learn?
- Today, it was more of a life lesson instead of something from code. Had we written this test perhaps 3 weeks back or so, I would not have experienced the problems that I experienced because I was focused on vanilla js... so what I've learned today is to always go back and revise and not shut stuff I've already learned outside.

# Plan?
I have to try finish freeCodeCamp tomorrow, the React js questions. I'm going to do the best I can.
