# What Happened?
Today I was late because of an errand I had to run in Joburg and that resulted me in being late for the day, however, I did some self-introspection of why is it that I haven't effectively learned react yet and what should I do to try and learn it more and more effectively to understand what is going on.

# The Day?
The day isn't that off from being productive although the only way to actual find a solution to a problem is to act.

# What Did You Learn?
- I have begun to get used to the coding grounds and somehow, the fact that there isn't strict pressure applied to us for learning, somehow makes me comfortable which can be a potential enemy for effective learning.
- I am not focusing at all because of the freedom that we're given and it seems that I am not disciplined enough with it and I am going to change that because the workplace my give me the same freedom and privileges.
- The other thing that came to my attention is the lack of engagement that we receive from the alumni, in this case Njabulo and Moral in terms of accountability and a sense of responsibility because we've only recieved marks for a single test whereas we've written at least 3. So I believe that we need some motivation and some engaging with alumni as well and somehow, that might create more excitement and energy on my learning as well.

# Plan?
- Action, because I've notified myself of the problems, all that's left is to try and find a solution to solve them.
