# What Happened?
I came this morning and worked and worked and worked, all in efforts to reach my daily goal and also worked a little bit on my typing but not really. Also to just mention, I came in a rather impaired condition as I had to deal with tonsils all day.

# The Day?
I had a challenging day today with the challenge being sick and also the basic data structures not feeling so basic. Some problems were very difficult for me and that didn't do any justice to the time management.

# What Did You Learn?
## Basic Data Structures
- This topic covers plenty of data handling using different operators and built in elements of javaScript and most of the topics were covered in the basic javaScript subsection on freeCodeCamp however they went more in detail and attention and explanation and I understand it much better now.

# Plan?
Currently, I just have to improvise some more now because I couldn't reach today's goal.
