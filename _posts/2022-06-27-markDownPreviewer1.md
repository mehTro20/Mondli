# Project Markdown Previewer
Today is the first day I begin with the markdown previewer and there's something that I remembered from learning from freeCodeCamp and also there are some questions that I am asking myself.

- One of the small tasks when learning react is the handle change function and it's use, and what simply happens in a nutshell, is that the same thing being typed within the input bar immediately is shown as an output as well on the user interface without the necessity of a submit button.

- Since that how this works and the project model works the same way, my question leads me ask whether it's going to be possible that I change the input box to become a whole type of a form... I still do have to make the research to find out whether that is true or not and if it is not, then I should find another way to try and make it work however, it cannot be done without the handle change function because the changes made have to be immediately seen on the UI.

# Plan?
Find the answers to these questions and try to work from there.
