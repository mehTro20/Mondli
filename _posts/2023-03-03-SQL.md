# Introduction

Since last week Wednesday, I have been trying to learn SQL with goals to understand and to try and connect it to Node.js and, it's been a trip and plenty of trying to understand and fighting back and fourth however, enough progress has been made thus far.

# Body

I've since learned the following about SQL:

- It has it's own commands which may lead to the conclusion that it is its own langauge because of the special commands it uses to run.

- Once understood, you could picture it as the most organized library amongst other libraries which is why it is better than most Databases.

- Like JavaScript that has other frameworks, such as React and Vue, SQL also has what I would call sub-databases such as mySQL, postgreSQL, MariaDB, etc...

- What makes SQL like a very organized library, is the commands it has. You can filter anything by anything, you can link tables, you can organize information, you can edit tables, you can edit particular information in a tsunami of information with just a single command.

There's other things I've learned, such as commands and their meanings but I want to understand SQL some more.

# Conclusion

Just as another language takes time to be learned, I need to have the same attitude in trying to learn SQL and just like a spoken language, I will only learn by practicing more and more.
