# What Happened?
Today, after a restful weekend, I went back to doing some more and more CodeWars with the goal to reach a 70 on that top right number on the screen and I did so, after battling or training the few katas, which were not so easy and were time consuming.
And yes, I did reach the goal I set for myself, which is a victory.

# The Day?
A good start to the week, to be able to successfully solve a code problem always feels victorious for me in the javaScript war that I've been fighting since I got here. There was a particular code that would take an array of only 3 values and I would have to return the index of the number between the mininum and the maximum numbers. And so the idea came that I could sort them, and then assign the middle value to a variable and call its index but unfortunately the sort method mutates the original array but then I found a way to use the method without mutating/changing the original array and guess who came up on top?

# What Did You Learn?
## Sort Method
- This method will sort the elements of an array, meaning it will sort numerical elements in numerical order and word element in alphabetical order.
- This method mutates the original array.

# Plan?
I am going back to working on freeCodeCamp tomorrow but will be returning to code wars everyday.
