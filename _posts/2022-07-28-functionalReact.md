# What Happened?
Today, I took the opportunity to learn functional react js and I've learned enough today alone to come to the conclusion that I should have learned this type of react first instead of the class component as freeCodeCamp has taught me... and all of this is only because, I find it easier to learn and connect and there's less code being used and everything is more precise and simpler.

# The Day?
Today was a much more productive day than most of the days I've spent figuring out what to do with the drum machine using class component react, and with more time spent with functional react would bring back plenty of confidence as well and more effective learning since that's what I've been aiming all along.

# What Did You Learn?
## colourChangeApp
Today I started with the first ever react task we were given which may be over 2months ago, and since I had done this app using class component react, I thought I would take the opportunity to convert to functional react and I learned about the following...

- Hooks! This is a set of code that is meant to work with state and manipulation of state as well.
- I learned that I had to install the plugin hooks for the hooks to actually work, which is something I also didn't know.

- The code was simpler and I learned that from now on, this is the direction that I am taking.

# Plan?
Tomorrow is a test, and I have slightly more confidence than I did before learning functional programming, and even though I haven't mastered everything, I pretty more confident than if I had to use class component, and I also believe that when I do master functional react, class component react might make a bit more sense.
