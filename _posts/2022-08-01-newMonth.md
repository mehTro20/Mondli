# Project Drum Machine
Today, I attempted to continue with the drum machine and I came to this conclusion...
- I am going to skip the drum machine because I am simply not ready enough to build one based on my own thinking and js ability.
- I have given the drum machine more than 3 weeks of time trying to work it out and trying to understand, even watched some youtube videos however, I still don't understand what is happening or why.
- Having newly learned some functional react, I thought perhaps that would be able to skip plenty of the trouble and get to the solution however, it is still a problem, and so with all that difficulty, I've decided to skip the drum machine and I will return to it later when I've grown up in coding.

# Plan?

Since this is a new month and since we had a touchbase with Tanille last week Friday, I have decided to try and change how I do things and make sure that I work with setting daily goals for myself from now on and making sure I complete them to try and grow myself and more importantly catch up with the syllabus.
