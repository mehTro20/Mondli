# What Happened?
So today we got to do the first ever test that we are going to be marked on, and its a big deal for me because it so happens that I want good marks for it. The test is about making a responsive website with some given thing that we have to have in the website.

# The Day?
I can say that its been the most stressful day but without the stress even though some pressure was surely there. 
- I just hoping to get good enough marks for the test and it was also a wake up call for me when it comes to building projects and not taking css for granted because I came across plenty of trouble. PLENTY.

# What Did You Learn?
## CSS
- Today with some wisdom from the seniors, I learnt the hard way that you cannot use CSS Flexbox and also use CSS Grid at the same time. You have to pick one and then go with it.

- This was something I saw when I tried this:

```
.items {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3 minmax(0, 1fr))
}
```

...that is using both CSS flexbox and CSS grid at the same time and the thing won't work or adjust because it has already applied the flexbox.

# Plan?
I have to carry on with freeCodeCamp tomorrow and await the results from Moral tomorrow. Hopefully I did well.
