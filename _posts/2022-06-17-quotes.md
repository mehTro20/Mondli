# What Happened?
An idea has come to me that I should do different types of posts when I'm focusing or busy with a project, meaning that from now on, posts that I'll be writing while in the middle of working on a project will have a different format than the casual.

# Project Quote Generator Machine
Today, I came across something confusing for me big time. When it comes to the quotes and where to get them is what is completely confusing me and I have no direction of how to go about it.
- My other issue right now is that codepen doesn't seem to support React in the way it's been taught to me, so I will have to essentially do it the old way since it html, css and js seems to be separated.

- After solving these problems, I believe that css will be the last problem as the functionality of the machine will be done and working.
