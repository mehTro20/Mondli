# What Happened...

Today I continued some more with the tasks on freeCodeCamp and made some more progress, about more than 80% done, of which I can say that tomorrow I will surely be done with the tasks on back end development.

- We also had a meeting with Tanille today, where she was doing some practical and monthly check up on our progress and how we're growing and things revolving our lessons here at The Coding Grounds.

# The Day...

More smooth although I had to get some help when it comes to the coding because of not understanding the questions and sometimes how I write the code and everything. 

- The meeting with Tanille went well and was very useful too.

# What I Learned...

## Wording

In today's tasks, I would get questions setting up in different ways, such as "... respond with a JSON document..." which are new things to me and I had to get some help to understand what was being requested of me.

# Plan?

By tomorrow I will have successfully completed the back end development.
