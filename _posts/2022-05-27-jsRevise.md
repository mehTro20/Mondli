# What Happened?
Today I decided to try and do some revision of the test and it was surprising how I've forgotten the basics of js because the tasks we were given were actually easier than I thought, however, I never memorized them because of constantly of googling whenever I don't know what to do with a certain problem I have to solve.
- I also pushed a bit of React on freeCodeCamp but unfortunately was unsuccessful in reaching my goal of finishing js before the end of the week.

# The Day?
The day was productive and progressive because of the hard lesson I had to learn, all in all, I keep learning and learning.

# What Happened?
## JS
- My thoughts are that perhaps, during primary school when a calculator was not allowed, it was good for us to build our mathematic abilities and not always depend on the calculator because eventually, we would stop thinking and turn to it all the time. Perhaps for someone who is learning code, google is that calculator.

# Plan?
Monday, it has to be Monday where I finish the React section.
