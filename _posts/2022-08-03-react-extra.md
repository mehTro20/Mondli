# What Happened...
Today, I was working on some more D3 when around 10 o'clock, Njabulo called Akhona and I and gave us separate tasks today that revolve around react.

# The Day...
Today was a useful day, and I would even say that it was a very useful day because of the lessons from the seniors on react which is something that I believe I needed.

# What I Learned...
## react
- So the task that I was given had to be a simple functional calculator and so the idea is that I should build it first before recieving any pointers or help of some sort. 
- My goal throughout would be to try and build this with as little google as possible, and so I did so according to my understanding.
- The app was functional however the way in which I coded it was completely off because react does not use vanilla js way of coding.

- I had to learn about handleChange and how to target values from inputs and there was more to learn and I learned today and how to manipulate state.

# Plan?
I think after I am correctly done with this project, I'm going to ask Njabulo to give me another task, all within efforts of getting to understand and build more react.
