# What Happened?
Today, friends of Jason and Tanille joined us to give us more empowering tips and lessons on interviews and a realistic and actual 5 minute interview!

# The Day?
The day was a nice and refreshing different day and alot was learned and most of all it was just a general nice and fun day, even though we were all learning, being empowered and everything.

# What Did You Learn?
## Interviews
- I learned that I should always stick to answering the questions as clear as simply and as short as I possibly can.
- I don't think rambling around until I forget or stray away from the actual point will do justice as well.
- I learned about dress code as well, which will be a green in future and onwards.

# Plan?
Our friends said they will return perhaps within the next two months or so, to continue to empower us when it comes to interviews and the real world in general out there, so I plan to prepare some more than I was prepared today.
