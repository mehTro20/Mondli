# What Happened?
Today, unfortunately was not as productive day for me. In the morning I had to go to Makro and we spent more time there than necessary outside already waking up not that regenerated and well-rested.
- I started with some typing in the morning then worked on njabulo's first react app.

# The Day?
I was not well rested when I woke up this morning and I do think that affected my day for the entire day, and so this day was just not as productive as the rest this week.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- I'm beginning to understand more and more what state actually mean but I still don't understand what use the 'this' keyword has and why it's so important.

# Plan?
One way or another, I have to get Njabulo's task done before 11 o'clock tomorrow. 

REACT is currently difficult for me.
