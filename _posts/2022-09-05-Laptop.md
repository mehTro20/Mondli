# What Happened...
Today I finally recieved the laptop from Tumi and from now on, I really want to start with the more effective learning methods and recieving this device has a nice feeling to it and I feel like there's some new things and some new beginning of some sort.

- I also continued some more with the freeCodeCamp tasks of the back end development today.

# The Day...

The day today went okay, I wouldn't say there's been a frustrating time where perhaps I was stuck somewhere or didn't know what to do at a certain task on freeCodeCamp so then I would even say further that the day was rather easy and good.

# What I learned...

- Today I did more and more back end development and most of the work that I did has to do with how the back end functions and to be honest, I think I have to come back later to look more into the details of the lessons being taught because right now, I am more rushing into masterting react and getting to understand SQL and MongoDB and Mongoose right now, so I cannot say that I am effectively giving attention to the current tasks at hand however, that is not to say that I'm flying through everything without reading, no, I am just not giving the effective time to properly understand everything there.

# Plan?

I will still continue with the back end developments for the rest of this week and see how far I get however, I don't think I will be giving attention to any project or starting any project this week.
