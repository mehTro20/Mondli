# What Happened?
As planned, as a second plan, I've succeeded in completing Reactjs on freeCodeCamp and although I am finally done, it is without question that I'll have to do it again and that I am still in need of more and more learning of react js.

# The Day?
Much more productive than the previous, and is a much needed routine/habit because I have plenty of work to cover and tomorrow is the first day of June. 
- I will be starting with Redux tomorrow.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Today, what I learned is that the map & filter methods can also be incoporated in React however, the syntax has just a slight twist to it although and I also learned that React takes li tags as an unordered list unless you specify.

# Plan?
I don't think this week should finish before completing redux and I also want to up my productivity levels. I believe this will generally make me a better human being. But still with not the intention of overtaking my learning speed.
