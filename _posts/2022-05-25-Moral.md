# What Happened?
Today, as planned, I continued some more with freeCodeCamp in the quest of trying to learn some React js. 
- Around 1 o'clock, Moral did some revision with us regarding the test and how we did, and that was a much needed session as well.

# The Day?
Pretty much the usual.
- I'm realizing that my confidence alternates like a rollercoaster because of the different questions and tasks that I come across on freeCodeCamp. I mentioning this because, today a lot of confidence was built and I think it because of the fairly easy tasks that I faced on freeCodeCamp regarding react.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Today I came across some inline styling syntax for react and I realized that the default unit for measurement is pixels (px) otherwise, like the rest of values for properties, you have to put the values with quotes.

- I also learned that to do inline styling, you have to used double curly braces otherwise known as parenthesis unlike the normal way done in HTML.

# Plan?
Tomorrow is the javaScript test and I plan on acing it too as much as I did the responsive web test.
