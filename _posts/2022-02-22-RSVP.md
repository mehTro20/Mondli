# What Happened?
I managed to focus some more on JavaScript and as planned I looked into some more videos to give me a better understanding. We were also officially given a task to create an RSVP form using CSS and HTML only and I managed to begin with that too.

# The Day?
Cool and collected, calm and well managed. I can't say I struggled but I handled everything properly.

# What Did You Learn?
Nothing new today but did some more referring to previous JavaScript lessons.

# Plan?
The problem or task that I've been given on FreeCodeCamp has proven to be not only a hassle to me but also a pain to most of my seniors because I finally requested help from them. So the only plan I have right now is to solve and crack that task.
