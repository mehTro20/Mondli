# What Happened?
Today, a fresh start to a new week but also a cold one, I decided to try and continue with learning React on freeCodeCamp but also gave more time to codeWars because of wanting to get my number up and visiting some Kata because it has been a while since I checked codeWars.

# The Day?
Slow but fast, I guess the problem that I was facing on codeWars was taking it's toll on me and I would even say messing with my confidence as well because, I didn't anticipate it would be such a hassle for me. But after recieving some help from Mark, I moved on and tried another kata. The day today was codeWars.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- I learned how to nest tags or maybe you could call it, 'calling react components'. React seems to have it's own difficulty and I still believe that it might give me some trouble on getting to know it better just like how javaScript initially was to me, but for now, I can only focuse on learning.

# Plan?
Tomorrow I will try to manage both codeWars again and learning React, with an intention of putting more attention on React.
