# What Happened?
Today was one of the few days were I woke up without having enough rest so, it was more of a dragging day than the usual. 
- I did some more freeCodeCamp today, and still learning and learning and I will have to outsource some of the things that I still do not know.

# The Day?
Not as productive with the sole reason that I do not understand what to dispatch means, I don't understand the necessity of provide and I don't fully how to link react and redux together right now.

# What Did You Learn?
## Linking
- Today's exercises were about linking react and redux together with the connect method and also having a class to render the the provider including the const that uses the connect method.

# Plan?
Still the same as Friday, and that is to try and finish react and redux this week so I may move on to the projects.
