# What Happened?
Today, as planned was a day filled with freeCodeCamp, and some practice typing which is also something that I do every single day actually.
- Covered and worked on some more and more React js.

# The Day?
Much better than yesterday and much more productive and less sleepy and much better in general. I happen to be much more active and tried learning more and more react js.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Today I finally understood what it components do, and also a parent vs a child component. Although I can't say that I would do it by myself yet.

- I also learned that set a default prop value and that you can override those prop values.

- Lastly, I am still going to need some more and more time when it comes to react js because most of the time, I am connecting dots when I do the tasks on freeCodeCamp not neccesarily understanding what exactly is happening as of yet... but I will.

# Plan?
I plan on continuing with freeCodeCamp and that only because I do have a deadline to meet.

- I've also decided to make a side project to keep practicing my responsive web developer able side alive and not forget any simple html, css or js.
