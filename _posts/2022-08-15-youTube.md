# What Happened...

Today I took the first step to developing new habits if I ever hope to master react js and decided that, with just the todo list, completing it would be a good first step to understanding react js...

- So with that, I decided that I should look up on YouTube how to build a simple to do list and got to learn some more in a day from a single video than how long it might have taken me when I did some manual googling.

# The Day...

The day was productive, more productive because I do believe there's different ways to learn and to master things and I haven't gone into this type of learning.

- But I can do better with the time management, however, I am happy with how many times fewer than usual I got distracted by my phone.

# What I Learned...

## Components

- So the video covered a bunch of things that I didn't know which includes creating a folder and files within it that contain JSX and how to export and import all that data you've created.

- Even when it comes to hooks, I would have not known that when importing the components, after using that component as a normal html self-closing tag, that I would have to pass down hooks within that same tag...

- These are all things that I've effectively learned today.

# Plan...?

I don't know if learning faster will be possible but I can try do that or at least cut down some more on time spent being distracted but I don't want August to finish while I'm still on react alone.
