# What Happened...

These past 3 weeks have been the most tough weeks potentially out of my entire life and that is only because, the unthinkable happened.

- That which happened has nothing to do with code and has everything to do with family and being essentially homeless for a limited time.

- Which resulted in my learning being affected because of troubles that I faced along the road, where I couldn't even attend the coding grounds because of not having security of whether it will still be okay for me to return to the same place that I've slept in.

- And so I would opt to rather not go to school.

- But I have returned now since this past Tuesday and I am slowly but surely beginning to recover the flow I had at school and I've started with MongoDB and Mongoose and I am currently doing the best I can within the sub-topic.

# The Day...

Today was a rather good day, however busy again especially because it was my day to mop and do the weekly cleaning that we take turn in doing within the coding grounds.

- I also continued with MongoDB and Mongoose and still doing more and more work with it expecting to be done with it at least early next week.

# What I learned...

- When it comes to most of the back end, I cannot lie, its more difficult than the front-end works because I can actually see what I'm busy doing and I can see the changes to what I'm building however when it comes to the back-end, I cannot see how my change in code affects what I am doing.

- So because of this, I cannot say that I am effectively learning, however with time I will have to go back and do some more YouTube to get some lessons there on back-end and hopefully I'll be able to see what being done.

# Plan?

I just have to keep on keeping on, and I am ready for more tests on the topics that I've covered already such as React js.
