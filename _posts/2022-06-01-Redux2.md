# What Happened?
Today I continued with Redux on freeCodeCamp and I have just one more task to do till I am done with the Redux section on freeCodeCamp.
- I also did some searching on YouTube to try and get some videos where React would be more thoroughly explained.

# The Day?
The day was productive as I hoped it would be but could've been more productive.

# What Did You Learn?
## Redux
- So this whole time when working within a reducer, within our switch statements to handle multiple activity, we have been mutating original state and today I learned out to alter the code in a way that would not mutate original state however send new state, and this would be by making the data structure into an array.

# Plan?
The plan from here on is to try for a better and more productive day, but also filled with understanding instead of learning new things or skimming through information but not necessarily understanding, because that's actually not learning at all.
