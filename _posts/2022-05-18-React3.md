# What Happened?
Today, as planned I continued with some and more freeCodeCamp while educating myself with React js and of course its been another beating of a day because of not understanding the terminology when it comes to react js.

# The Day?
Today was not that much better than yesterday, and I think there a bad habit pattern that is trying to develop itself because my whole attitude today surrounding learning was awful.

- I even spoke with one of my peers about it and she's also having the same think happening to her. Some sort of a low energy and enthusiasm towards the learning that we have to do.

- I was experiencing the same thing when I was still learning javaScript, and now, although I a still learning it, my attitude is better but when something is difficult and I don't seem to power up with motivation but somehow get demotivated, with that affecting my attitude including energy levels towards the whole thing.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- From creating default values for properties and overriding them to setting state today and having onclick functions and setting types of data of properties today.

All that I've learned today will require more time for me to properly grasp, I just have to keep doing it and understand the terminology much better as well.

# Plan?
I have to prepare for the javaScript test that I have coming up and try to finish react so I can start it all over again sooner.
