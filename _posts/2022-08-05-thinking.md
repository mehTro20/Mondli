# Project Calculator
### What Happened...
- I continued with the project today and there a few things that I realized about myself when it comes to coding and how well I progress when I do this particular thing.

- I've come to realize that when I vocalize what I need to get done, it helps in the process of discovering the solution for that particular problem, which is something that gave me some progress today with the project that I am currently busy with.

- Asking myself things such as, "why is there a blank screen after we did what we just did", or , "what do you need to happen"... then "ok, so how can we make that happen?

### What I learned...
I had an intial plan of making the textarea, some sort of an output screen to show what I am busy punching on the calculator, and then suddenly, I asked myself, "what is the meaning of 'textarea' when now you're no longer inputing within that text area?", then I realized my error and began working on other solutions to get an output effect.

- The other thing that I learned is that of asking myself and conversing to myself about the current objectives that I need to fulfill at those particular times and it was really good progress for me because I'll be doing this full time from now on.
