# What Happened?
This is the second day that I am doing the to do list and I did come across plenty of struggles. I do feel that freeCodeCamp has not covered majority of the things we have to apply on our project especially javaScript related things but I guess that's how the real world is anyway, you have to figure your way without any warning or sign that those things are going to happen.

# The Day?
The day was filled with issues around the todolist and although some were solved, there's still plenty to get done before the deadline on Monday. A trouble some day.

# What Did You Learn?
## HTML Table
There is specific html tags to get a specific table with headings and items below the correct headings.
- Tables have Headings <thead>, Bodies <tbody> and Foots <tfoot>

# Plan?
I spoke to Njabulo, one of our people who are in charge and give us projects, and I asked him if it was okay that I come during the weekend and he didn't mention any problem and so I need to use that extra time to try and catch up so I don't miss the deadline.
