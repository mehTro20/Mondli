# What Happened?
More learning, and nothing outside the ordinary, and I can confidently say that I am better in javaScript, although it takes me long to crack a code, but all that matters right now to me is being able to crack it without any help, and so, that's what I did today.

# The Day?
The day was a victory for my team against the toughness of the freeCodeCamp. Even though I would say that I am behind schedule, I am learning javaScript! I am slowly but surely getting there and applying the mentality and getting used to the hardship and getting used to the hardship means that there's is no hardship at all and when there's no hardship at all, its only a matter of time. That's my attitude right now.

# What Did You Learn?
## Flat Method
- So in a world of multi dimensional arrays, the flat method will undo all that unnecessary junk(when it's actually unnecessary) and return a one dimensional array.

```
let arr = [1, [2, [4, [5]]];
let flattened = arr.flat();

console.log(flattened)
```

- The console would show a normal one dimension array with the values of 'arr'
- I learned this method because of a task I got from freeCodeCamp

# Plan?
After what Mandla and Theo encouraged us with yesterday, I plan to try and better my habits and also try and give more attention to my learning so I can get better results. Above all, try to up my pace with the freeCodeCamp.
