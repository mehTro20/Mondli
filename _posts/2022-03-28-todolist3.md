# What Happened?
This morning I came with the eager goal of getting the to do list done but if not done, at least have it working and functional. If the page doesn't look pretty, at least the code behind it should be pretty. Well I did just that however I am still not finished but the functionalities are 80% done.

# The Day?
Not as stressful as anticipated and it did start early because I came here at 06h30, which is an all time early record for me and my efforts since coming to The Coding Grounds. Overall the day was good and that can simply be because I could handle and find solutions to the problems that were presented to me.

# What Did You Learn?
## Modal Box
This is basically the nerd term for popups, and of course freeCodeCamp didn't teach me this just like the 70% of the things applied for projects.
- I am using the modal box to help with editing on the to do list.
- When the user clicks on the edit button, they should recieve a popup containing the intial inputs of that particular set and change them.

# Plan?
As soon as I am done with the to do list, I have to carry on with freeCode Camp and this could result in me having to come in early just like today to give myself more time so I can finish in time.
