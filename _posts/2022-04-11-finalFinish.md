# What Happened?
New week, same war same progress, same eventual outcome.
- I continued to work on the freeCodeCamp and there has been progress of finally being done with the intermediate algorithm scripting, which is an ultimate victory and we just have one more to go before being done with javaScript in freeCodeCamp. Great news!

# The Day?
The day was good and I would say that the time used was used productively and properly. All good throughout.

# What Did You Learn?
## typeof js keyword
- The 'typeof' keyword is an inbuilt js keyword that will return the type of a variable when you call it.

```
const arr = [3, 4 , 5]
console.log(typeof arr)

//the output should be 'array'
```

## Math.round
- This is a function that returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

# Plan?
We have to complete js and be done at least by Wednesday so we can be able to start the following week with a fresh start, I believe I've used too much time on javaScript on the freeCodeCamp but I just believe that it had to be used because learning it and understanding is the actual goal above finishing.
