# What Happened?
So today I had a simple goal to try and reach ECMAscript however, unfortunately I didn't reach that goal today due to the profile lookup that was tasked from freecodecamp. It took long to figure out and then the following task happen to be difficult as well. Difficult because I don't know the language well-enough to understand. What also occurred is that when I got the solution correct the test still ran my code as a fail. I couldn't figure out why but I was forced to take a peak at the solution on stackoverflow and one of the solutions looked exactly as my solution looks but for some reason mine wasn't allowing me to proceed to the next task, this nearly brought frustration to me.

# The Day?
Shorter than most, I do have to say.
I focused more and more into JavaScript and the task at hand however well handled as usual in terms of emotional control.

# What Did You Learn?
### Loops
- I had to include loops within my solution code and only then did I actually understand the true use of a loop and to explain it: Think of an engine in the car. So long as it runs, the car is ready to accelerate on a hill but the car will stop acceleration as soon as the engine is turn off. So loops are set with a particular rule that as long as the rule is true, the code within that loop will keep running until the rule is no longer true, then it breaks which means it stops running.
### Generating random numbers
- I learned particular code that allows random numbers to be generated however I cannot go into more detail about it because I still need to understand it better.

# Plan?
I have to go back to watching more videos again. I cannot rely on FreeCodeCamp alone because it doesn't explain in detail enough and it doesn't give that clarity. I plan on watching some more and more videos again so I can finally crack this language.
