# What Happened...
So I am proud to say that today, I reached the goal that I set up for myself today and I am glad that I have successfully reached a goal that I set up for myself.

- Moral also told me that next week we have another js test and so I might have to prepare for that soon as well...

- We also worked on other things after I achieved what I set up for myself, of which what we worked on, is something more difficult and that's good to me.

# The Day...

Another successful day with satisfaction because of the achievements reached today.

# What I Learned...
## Tables

One of the difficulties that I had trouble with today was the humble and basic, html table set up of which I got through it but because I am mapping out the results, I had to be more vigilant about where I place my parent tr tags and printing out using the td tags.

# Plan?

I will be continuing with the project and try to achieve the more difficult task at hand.
