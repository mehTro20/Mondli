# What Happened?
Today after finishing with Redux on freeCodeCamp, I decided to revise the Reactjs some more and more so I can learn and get the language more and more in my head.
- The following topic concerns react and redux and I want to start the new section with a clear head.

# The Day?
I would make an exception because it's Monday from a very busy Sunday, however not that productive nonetheless but well used because React is an important topic to cover and with the research that I've made, it would benefit me to really be good at Reactjs.

# What Did You Learn?
## Redux
- With the task of handling state without mutating original state, working with object/array data types is the best way to work around the trouble of not mutating original state. Today I got to work with the object assign method, which is not one that I fully understand yet as I don't have a clear picture about how state works or how it's handled as yet.

# Plan?
Tomorrow I begin with React and Redux and hopefully, if I complete quick, I think I want to try myself another React project to keep practicing.
