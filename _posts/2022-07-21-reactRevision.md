# What Happened?
So today, Samuel decided to help us with the revision for the test so we could learn and see where we went wrong, and it also happen that I was not the only one who struggled dismally and that most of us were in need of the revision.

# The Day?
The day was a helpful one however not so helpful as well due to the fact that there is a difference with class component and functional react programming and unfortunately, Samuel knows functional react better than class component react and that resulted in us not fully getting the complete revison that we needed but just a piece of it.

# What Did You Learn?
A handleSubmit function was needed and I still don't have the complete understanding of why it's necessary including the handleChange function as well because I thought it has to do with something of a nature of immediate change to the output however, I still need to more revision.

# Plan?
I need to see whether we're going to do the revision tomorrow as well because I certainly do need it.
