# What Happened?
More JavaScript, and better approach to my problems. Better attitude and less frustration has allowed my to be able to solve and apply more logic to JavaScript.

# The Day?
Much better than yesterday. Much cooler, better handled, better food, better focus, better approach to problems and overall productive in terms of learning.

# What Did You Learn?
- Replacing If,Else with Switch
- Returning Boolean values from functions
- Objects
- Accessing object properties with variables

# Plan?
Well I'm not proud to say that I've failed to reach my goal of finishing basic javascript on FreeCodeCamp to begin with ES6 next week. However I do plan to try pace up next week.
