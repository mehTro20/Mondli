# What Happened?
Today was rather better day than Friday and I think I needed it most because I do feel as if I am finally beginning to get react js because...
- Today I focused on freeCodeCamp and what I have been doing is taking pictures of all of my solutions alongside the question at hand to help me understand the terminology much better and I think it's beginning to make sense to me now.

# The Day?
The day was fantastic because I am beginning to understand the terminology and what I have to do and also the syntax that comes along with it. Bit by bit, its getting better and better.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- I understand what rendering is, or rather, when I am told that something has to be rendered, I understand what is being asked of me instead of truly understanding what rendering is.

- I understand why we created handleSubmit methods as well when it comes to outputting.

- I think once I learn the terminology better, I may have to do the whole section again to understand the practical use of the things freeCodeCamp is teaching me.

# Plan?
I plan to finish the React js section of freeCodeCamp by the end of this week.
