# What Happened...

Today, I came up with even more solutions than the previous time I worked on my Tumi assignment and things.

# The Day...

It was a good morning and a good afternoon as well especially because of all the work and the solutions this day had and even though I do not fully understand some of my solutions that I had today, still, its very satisfying.

- I worked on the Tumi react app this whole day.

# What I Learned...

## useEffect

I still don't fully understand the functionality of this hook however, when it comes to adding the local storage, it became very important to use and was working had in hand with state.

- I tried checking the "componentDidMount" method and how it functions and I won't say that I fully understood either but I do understand that useEffect has the same use.

# Plan?

Tomorrow I completely finish with the functionality of this app!!

- NB: Tumi might add some more things and functionalities but I'll be done with the initial ones.
