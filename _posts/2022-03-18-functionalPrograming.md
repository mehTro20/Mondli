# What Happened?
Came this morning with the goal of completing the whole sub-topic of functional programming and unfortunately couldn't pull it off as, there were difficult questions there too.

# The Day?
I would say that since I didn't understand everything that I had to learn, today felt much more longer and difficult. I also believe I have a problem because I can't even think creatively to solve the problems, I believe that my tolerance of stress, particularly javaScript, is high and because of that, it is easily triggered and I'm unable to recover because my mind already believes that this is too hard and I can't think of an answer.
- I even took a breather outside to try and relieve myself of the stress because absolutely nothing will be achieved if I carry on going this way and I had to find ways to motivate myself to keep trying.

- I used to believe that I could learn anything and also believed that coding in particular was never going to be too hectic of a field for me to understand but my mentality has been shifted from that because of the constant defeats that I'm suffering from javaScript... But what choice do I have but to keep fighting?

# What Did You Learn?
## Func Programming
1. Input -> Process -> Output
- Isolated functions: Independent functions, meaning they don't get affected by the state of the program
- Pure functions: same input always gives same output
- Limited side effects: Carefully controlled changes or mutations.

## Functions
1. First class functions - functions that can be used in various ways from being passed into another function or passed to declare a variable, etc.
2. Higher order functions - functions that take a function as an argument or return a function as a return value.
3. Lambda - function passed in to or returned from another function.

## Principles
- Instead of altering global variables, it is better to declare function parameters which will introduce whatever changes you wish to make when you call those functions and set arguments.

# Plan?
I have 2 outstanding projects that are due next week, of which one of them is from Moral, the omega senior and we have been told that it's for marks and will count, so I plan on dedicating time to completing these projects next week.
