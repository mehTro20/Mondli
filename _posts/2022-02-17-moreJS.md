# What Happened?
As planned, giving more and more attention to JavaScript and trying to understand it better. It is not easy and I'm having my challenges but I'm certain that with more time I will understand it.

# The Day?
Frustrating. Class was hot today and I'm unsure if I had enough sleep before coming into class but it hasn't been an easy day and the challenges of JS did not make it any better.

# What Did You Learn?
- Operators
- If & else statements
- Arranging code
- Switch statements

# Plan?
I struggled a lot with focusing today and my attitude to some problems that I faced concerning JS was not correct and not productive at all and possibly counter productive because you cannot think of a solution when you are frustrated. My plan is to try take care of that problem as soon as possible.
