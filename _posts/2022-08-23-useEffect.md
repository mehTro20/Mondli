# What Happened...

Today I continued with the Tumi project and came across some new problems today because of today's goals which is something.

- I also found the solution to today's problems as well and as some of the problems of tomorrow. Great stuff!!

# The Day...

It was a good day for sure but I believe that perhaps I can manage my time better and do better when it comes to how much time I commit to the working..

# What I Learned...

## useEffect
So I still don't understand the hook itself however, what I was doing is setting local storage using this hook and from what I understood...

- ...the local storage was going hand in hand with the current state and the problem with that is, if a page refreshes or you switch to another page, the state clear and so the local storage will do the same.

- I now had to declare local storage without using the useEffect hook so even if the state clears, the local storage is safe and I can use it within another page.

# Plan?

I will be able to reach the goal that I set for myself tomorrow and be done with the project!
