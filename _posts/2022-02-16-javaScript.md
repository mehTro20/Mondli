# What Happened?
I committed many more hours today to progress and much less to breaks and breathers today. FreeCodeCamp the entire day and this post will be the last thing I commit.

# The Day?
I cannot say it was easy because JavaScript is a challenge. I cannot say I managed because there still so much that I've covered that I still don't fully understand myself.

# What Did You Learn?
- Separating strings & numbers
- Nesting arrays & manipulating them
- Function & return values
- Local scopes vs global scopes
- Arguments vs parameters

# Plans?
I want to keep the with the same pace with the goal of covering basic JavaScript to start with ES6 beginning of next week.
