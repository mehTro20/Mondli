# What Happened...
Today was another day dedicated to React js and learning more and more, and although we were sort of done with Tumi's task, he had other ideas and other modifications that he wanted to suggest and just before he could carry on with them, I stopped him and asked him for another react task he could give us, which was something that I was hoping for since yesterday...

- So mentally I was expecting a task that will test the level of my knowledge when it comes to react however, Tumi twisted the whole thing and gave us a multiple page app to do and complicated requirements and things and packages we had to research about with some new html tags that we never could've imagined existed.

# The Day...

Somehow, I feel that most of my days a getting better and better since trying to up my socks when it comes to learning react and everything...

- It as if, the less lazy these days are, mentally or physically, the more active they are and the more better they are...

- I began with Tumi's project and had to do some research, even though initially, I won't lie, it was a bit mentally troubling, considering that things I have never even heard of, were given to me as things that I had to implement on the project.

# What I Leaned...

## useNavigate
- So when it comes to the useState, which allows us to be able to use hooks, today I got introduced to 'useNavigate' and although I didn't do that much research on it today, but my guess is that it allows us to switch or change pages within the same app...

## react router-dom
- This is one of the packages that we had to install today and I think it has to do with the 'useNavigate' that was introduced to me today

# Plan?

Same plan as always when it comes to react, and I very much plan to do this project as functional and clean as possible.
