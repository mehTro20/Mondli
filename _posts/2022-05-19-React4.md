# What Happened?
Today was the 1st of many days in my new habit self program that I am putting myself through so I can generally improve myself and learn better and everything.

- I continued with freeCodeCamp, still taking it day by day and learning the bit that I can take for now.

# The Day?
The day was another good day and better than the previous since focusing on React js, and confidence boosting too.

- Tumi, the most concerned of the seniors, helped us today by giving us some lessons on React as well... giving some much needed pointers and practical lessons, unlike a single task like on freeCodeCamp and thorough explaining.

- I also managed to complete one task today without needing some help as well, which was very confidence boosting and proof that I am actually learning.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- Today on react I got to understand the terminology better than I did yesterday and also the methods and how their used.
- I got to understand components better as well and also I got to understand how to create a react js file including running that file.

# Plan?
I just have to try very hard to dedicate myself to developing these new habits but in time, everything will come together and make sense. 
- I'm going to continue learning react and also continue with js as well so I can be prepared for when the test comes.
