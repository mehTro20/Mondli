# What Happened?
For today, after coming in during the morning, I pushed a bit of freeCodeCamp and learned more about Js React and beyond 8 o'clock, I continued working and improving the ATM and got it to a satisfactory level and I am proud of myself.

# The Day?
This has been another good day for me and has given me more and more confidence generated because of the victories that I am having to javaScript and I am still going, learning more and more, even though I can never really say that I've got it all figured out when it comes to js.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- I did some js React on freeCodeCamp during the morning and learned that it's all about combining js with html, although there are a few differences in terms of how to declare classes and different types of functions as well, and plenty more details.

# Plan?
Although I was planning on doing more and more freeCodeCamp during the morning to push, I think I would rather be done with the project so that I can focus on React without any distractions because that might influence how well I learn it. Just see how much I could list in the above section about it, it's all because I'm focused on the ATM project and I guess I'm still not the champion in multitasking.
