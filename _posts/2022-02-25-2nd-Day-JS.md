# What Happened?
Plenty of YouTube videos was the theme of the day due to the learning plan that I've set up for myself. I was basically watching YouTube videos on basic JavaScript and working on my typing as well.

# The Day?
It was a busy day, long, fairly hot but I managed to cope and although the YouTube videos were a bit of a drag, I managed to lock at least 80% of what I learned today so I would say its been a good day.

# What Did You Learn?
Today I managed to cover small basics of the following:
- Variables & data types
- Functions & parameters
- String Concatenation
- If & else statements
- Arrays

# Plan?
I've done only one lesson on FreeCodeCamp about JavaScript which concerned 'commenting things out' in JavaScript and it was refreshing because it wasn't the first time I see the problem because I started off by sourcing knowledge from YouTube. So I plan on using this method and evaluating this method for the rest of the week.
