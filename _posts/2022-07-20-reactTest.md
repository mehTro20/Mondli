# What Happened?
Today, I will dedicate this blog post to my comments about my performance of the test.

- I dismally failed.
- All that I have been worried about when it comes to not mastering react properly in time, has finally caught up with me and reflected in my horrible defeat with today's test.
- We had to do a very simple to do list and give it buttons to delete and edit and we were required to make use of bootstrap and I couldn't even get to that part as the functional part of the test alone was defeating for me.
- Yesterday with the revision that I made, it did not help at all because somehow this was the result that perhaps I've been doing more memorising than actual learning because all other previous projects, I used plenty of help to get them done.

# What Did You Learn?
I refuse to allow myself to believe that maybe I'm just not as good when it comes to react, I need more time and more understanding and more react based projects, from the seniors as well because they are helpful and would get me into the groove of knowing what react is.

# Plan?
I'm already behind when it comes to the syllabus but I truly wish to make more time for react and implement more effective learning when doing so.
