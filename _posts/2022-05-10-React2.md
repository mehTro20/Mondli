# What Happened?
Today I got to work some more with React and there was progress although I have to say that React is quite the challenge, I think I'll need all the time in the world to understand it and I also work on some code wars.

# The Day?
The day was another powerful and busy and quite  rough if I may add.

# What Did You Learn?
## React
- I've done more and more rendering and calling properties and even though I am completing the tasks set for me I still don't understand what's happening, so I already know that it's going to take more than freeCodeCamp to learn and properly grasp React.

# Plan? 
Tomorrow I am writing a test on responsive web design so that's all there is and to continue with freeCodeCamp and some more codeWars.
