# What Happened...

So today I achieved the goal that I set up for myself which was the finish the sub-topic of basic node and express and from Monday... I would have been starting with MongoDB and Mongoose, however, for 3 days, I will be busy with a test that Moral will give me on Monday.

# The Day...

The day was completely fun because Moral came with his PS5 so when we were done with our goals, not all of us, some of us played some games and that was completely fun and enjoyable which is a refreshing way to spend some Fridays.

# What I Learned...

I now understand the language used when it comes to back end... wording such as "Mount a post handler"
- That is what I mostly understand however, how data is handled and what really happens, is something that I don't fully fully understand.

# Plan?
After the 3 days I will start with MongoDB and Mongoose and I plan to ace the test.
