# Project Calculator
Today, I managed to achieve what my goal was and to remind you, I had to try make sure that state is cleared as soon as I hit the equal button so that at least I could begin another equation without hitting that "AC" button, however, the new problem is that my calculator now has to find a way that if, instead of hitting another value button, what if I hit an operator button instead?

- So that means adding or dividing or subtracting from the result of the previous equation is now the new problem of which I'm still a bit unsure how I will get that done.

## Plan?
Right now, my plan is to begin a new project and try the to do list again by myself and see whether I can actually crack it or would it still show me some trouble, however, I feel like I should at least try my best to be sure and clean when it comes to the calculator before I can carry on.

- I don't wish that I abandon that calculator and have another unfinished work and then be confused about what my next objective was... I'm still mixed emojis about what my plan is next.
