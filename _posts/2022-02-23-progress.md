# What Happened?
I finally managed to achieve progress on FreeCodeCamp! After I've been stuck for more than 4days I'm finally managing to put the puzzles together. I'm celebrating this progress.

# The Day?
I have to say, I believe I've found a better way of handling and getting through the days psychologically and mentally and physically as well, because even today flowed in a smooth way but I really hope its not because of the weather.

# What Did You Learn?
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Iteration with Loops
- Nesting For Loops(currently learning)

# Plan?
Because we've been given a task to create an RSVP, I plan to use the remaining 2 days to commit to making it look the way I wish and of course better than my peers as well, although I won't use their work to measure mine.
