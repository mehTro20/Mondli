# What Happened?
I have been absent for 2 weeks due to a planned family responsiblity reason that occupied only one week and had everything went accordingly, I would have returned after one week, however, on the Sunday of the first week when I was meant to return, a sudden community strike happened where people were protesting electricity for some areas had blown up transformers and people have been left months without any electricity.
- The strike happened for about 3 days without relent until it stopped midday Thursday, of which I then arranged a certain transport to return but couldn't catch it in time and then that resulted in me being home for the remaining of the week until the transport was rearranged for the coming Sunday, which happened to be yesterday and that was when I was finally successfully made it back home safely and was finally able to resume with where I left off within the syllabus and with some much catching up to do.

# Plan?
I'm still working on the drum machine and I want to try and understand the exemplar first and properly and try to work on mine till success is reached.
