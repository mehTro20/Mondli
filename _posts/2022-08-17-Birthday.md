# What Happened...

Today is actually my birthday and I would say I had a good day because Tumi otherwise known as Samuel, gave us a task to do today and we had to use some methods to manipulate data of 1 thousand values.

- One of the other things that we had to do is when the user searches for something particular, the UI should return results of that particular thing.

# The Day...

The day was okay because there a lot that I got to learn although Tumi is not the best explaining person when it comes to reason why a certain code is being implemented but, I learned a lot today.

# What I Learned...

## Manipulation

So one of the problems we encountered was when the user searches whatever they would, the UI returns a new filtered list, and that would be the current state, meaning that if another search is done for a different item, then it would be done, not in the original list, but in the current sorted list... and so, we had to create another state for something more efficient to be done.

## JSON files

When trying to use the sort method, targeting a particular key, I did not know that dot notation does not work on a JSON file type of object but bracket notation is the only way it works.

# Plan?
More and more React for the rest of this month.
