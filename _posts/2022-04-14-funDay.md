# What Happened?
- Today, unlike most days, was a TCG fun day rather than a normal day, and it is probably because of this special long weekend that we have coming up as a country.
- We played games and saved some money up together to get more fun stuff and also get some food and everyone participated and also, just on the side, I got to know the personalities of some of my classmates more seeing how they were behaving from the games and their competitive spirit.

# The Day?
The day went well and it was a legitimate fun day because of the games we played, and the participation, although it doesn't translate the same way for my work unfortunately.

# What Did You Learn?
- Absolutely nothing regarding js today.

# Plan?
From next week Tuesday when we do return, I'll be going back to the freeCodeCamp and beginning with bootstrap and basically trying to develop those better habits that we've been talking about in the previous posts.
