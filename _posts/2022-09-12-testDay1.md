# What Happened...

Today I began with the test and Moral decided to give me a test to do a react js Calculator, of which from last week's meeting with Tanille, is exactly the type of test that I wanted to do because it a different category all together as compared to the recent tests we've been getting altogether.

# Today...

I would say a rather difficult day because of how my morning started. There's something eventful that happened and I still haven't found a way to tell Tanille about it as yet. But I think perhaps tomorrow I may be able to tell her.

- I did have a tough time focusing because even emotionally I've never been so drained and troubled and stressed at the same time, however, I do plan on letting Tanille know, just in cast this has a longer effect on me.

# What I Learned...

Today, I won't say there's anything new from code that I've learned that I didn't know about before and let's hope that tomorrow, I can get most of this test done so at least by Wednesday I might have more time to check the functionality properly or proof read my code and add a bit of css.

# Plan?

To have the calculator fully functional tomorrow with the least of least amount of flaws.
