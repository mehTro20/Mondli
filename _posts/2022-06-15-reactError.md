# What Happened?
Today, was trying to produce more and more progress when it comes to making the random quote machine and I came across an error that stole so much of my time before I asked the seniors for help and eventually recieved it from Muano.

# The Day?
The day did have progress it it nonetheless.
- My peers keeps asking me why do I use classes instead of using functional react and I keep telling them that it's because freeCodeCamp teaches class first however, I think I should begin some research into this functional way of using React.

# What Did You Learn?
## local host refused to connect
- This is the error I have been struggling with throughout the whole day and when I checked stackoverflow, it kept talking about stuff I cannot understand nevermind locate... however,
- ...Muano showed me a trick I can use to overwrite this problem and its to delete the node modules within the folder I am working on and to reinstall them, and somehow that works and helps to overcome the problem

# Plan?
The plan is to carry on working on the project, hopefully I can get it working before the end of Friday.
