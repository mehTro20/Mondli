# Project Quote Generator Machine
Today is a day of victory because of the progress that we have made today.
- I had the goal of at least having a quote showing when I click the button that is meant to serve such a purpose and I was successful today with the help of the seniors though, I think I should mention that, however, its still a successful day nonetheless.

- What I learned today though, or at least a conclusion that I've come to is that I should learn the functional way of programming for React js because the class components way of doing it is hindering alot. I am saying this because if I knew how to do the functional way of programming, there's an even higher chance that today I would be showing the author alongside the quote, which would be more progress than I've pulled off today.

# Plan?
By tomorrow I want to have the logical part of the project done and dusted so I can carry on and test the project on codepen because I will have to rewrite it on codepen.
