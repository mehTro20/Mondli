# What Happened?
Today, instead of focusing on the freeCodeCamp as planned, one of the seniors, Njabulo, decided to give us our first React js project or should I say task coz all we had to do was create a button that changes the background colour of the page.

# The Day?
The was good, and useful and educative as well because I do still feel that projects do a much better job because of their practicality than only have to do freeCodeCamp.

# What Did You Learn?
## Vs code
- Today I learned what you need and things to install when you want to install React js, and I also learned how to run the project that you're working on because the "Go Live" button does not work for react, instead in the terminal, you should run "npm start" then your app runs.

# Plan?
Tomorrow I will be continuing with freeCodeCamp and try to reach my goal of finishing react.
