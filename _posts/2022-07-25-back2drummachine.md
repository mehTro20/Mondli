# Project Drum Machine
Today, I decided to continue with the drum machine and add some more progress to the code today and with intentions of learning more and more effectively as well.
- I was trying to see whether how I access the sounds matters on how I manipulate data because on the exemplar, they use an object and it doesn't make sense to me, so I was seeing whether a single function returning a single sound will work if I call that function on an "onClick".

# Plan?
I have to try and develop those new habits because of how I have been doing things so far is clearly not working for me especially when coming to react and Jason just happen to say something that was already within my thoughts which is that freeCodeCamp is not enough and we have to commit ourselves more if we wanna learn effectively outside freeCodeCamp.
