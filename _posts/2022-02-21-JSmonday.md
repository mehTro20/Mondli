# What Happened?
First day of a new week, cannot really say much but proud to say that we have begun the week with good new week energy and I would certainly say that JavaScript is still giving us some trouble however I'm optimistic that in time I will crack it and understand it completely.

# The Day?
Flowed pretty well. I had good energy today and the atmosphere wasn't ruining that either. I gave some more attention to typing and even more attention to JS and also for an RSVP document that we've been given as a task from the seniors.

# What Did You Learn?
- How to test objects for properties
- Manipulating complex objects
- Accessing nested objects and arrays

# Plan?
I plan on making that RSVP the best one and when it comes to learning JS, I may be going to consult some more videos so I can get a clearer understanding of the logic.
