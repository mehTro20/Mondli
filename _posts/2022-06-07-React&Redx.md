# What Happened?
I worked on freeCodeCamp and began with react and redux and it was actually a perfect opportunity to try and learn some more about both.

# The Day?
The day was progressive, perhaps not as productive however progressive nonetheless because I got to learn some more and more about both redux and react.
- It took the whole day to do just one single task, for evidence that I still have a long way to go.

# What Did You Learn?
## React & Redux
- I'm beginning to connect the dots more and more, which is a good step towards the right direction at understanding the framework language it just has to be baby steps for now.

# Plan?
I going to work some more and more with freeCodeCamp in learning react & redux.
