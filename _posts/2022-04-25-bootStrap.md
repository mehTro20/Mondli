# What Happened?
Today I finally returned after being away for a whole week due to a funeral that happened back home. After a long week of no practical coding at all, I had to come back and bring myself back into the space and the continous learning, and I can feel that I've lost form, but I'm steadily getting back to it.
- While I began with bootstrap, Njabulo gave us a project to get done and I've been busy with that every since.

# The Day?
It's been a bit of an exhausting day, seeing that I was very busy all week and I haven't had enough rest to be fully back on form. Nonetheless, I began with bootstrap today and began the project at exactly 10 o'clock this morning and I am still busy with the project.

# What Did You Learn?
## Bootstrap
- This is also known as the bootstrap responsive CSS framework which is used making webpages responsive, meaning that no matter what the width of the screen accessing the page will be, the web-page will always adjust itself to look neat now matter how small or big that screen is.

- I can easily make images responsive using bootstrap by setting the class of the img to "img-responsive".

- There are normal buttons and there are bootstrap buttons and these buttons will remain responsive as well.

- Instead of setting the width of a button to 100%, I can simply add a class element and set it to 'btn-block'.

- The requirement for all of this to be possible is have a class set to 'container-fluid' that should affect the whole html code, which can simply be a div tag.

## Local Storage
- This is useful for storing data on the browser when working with data, however, what I learned today about local storage is that it can't be used on the console, you keep getting an error that 'localStorage is not defined'.

# Plan?
Nothing super, but just to continue with the project and get it right so I can return to making up for the lost time.
